# ðŸŒ±hugo-theme-dream

> **The Major Update in 2019-11-10:**

I completely rewrite the page layout to [masonry layout](https://masonry.desandro.com/).

Correspondingly, the configuration (`config.toml`) also has some breaking changes.

Please refer to the documentation for details.

If you have other problems, you can also ask in the [issues](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream/issues).
